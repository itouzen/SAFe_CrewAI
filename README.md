## Enhancement Ideas

    Add real-time collaboration features using WebSockets

    Integrate with Jira/ADO APIs for actual task tracking

    Add historical simulation data comparison

    Implement team sentiment analysis

    Add risk prediction models for dependencies

This implementation provides both a functional SAFe simulation and an engaging visual interface for understanding SAFe dynamics. The AI agents mimic real SAFe roles while Streamlit provides tangible artifacts for analysis.
